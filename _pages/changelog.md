Welcome to Twidget v1.0.5.

In order to keep a free version of Twidget available; we've introduced ads to the app. We've also reduced how often a widget refreshes to 30 minutes.

To further support the development and maintenance of Twidget, we've introduced in-app purchases and subscriptions. These will remove the ads, allow widgets to be refreshed minutely, and also allow specific accounts to be followed.
