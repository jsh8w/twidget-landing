# Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
Thank you for showing an interest in Twidget. I take your privacy very seriously. I neither want nor need to know anything about your personal data. Therefore, Twidget is built to keep your data completely private.

## Authentication
Your Twitter password **never** gets shared with Twidget. When you sign into your Twitter account via Twidget, it is done securely via Twitter’s website and Twidget is given **read-only** permission to your account via a token. You can revoke Twidget’s access to your account from Twitter’s website at any time. The app **does not** have write access to your Twitter account.

## Data Storage
Twidget uses the Twitter API to fetch tweets and profile information to display in the app. This data **does not** leave your device. The latest data is cached on your device for offline use. We do not and will never share, upload, or have access to this information. All your data stays strictly on **your** device.

## Premium Purchases
If you sign-up for Twidget Premium, either via Subscription or In-App Purchase, your billing information, address, and name are all maintained by the Apple App Store and are not visible to me. I will simply get information about whether or not you have purchased a subscription/in-app purchase, the term you signed up for and when it is due to expire. This is all made available to me in an anonymous fashion. This anonymous data is also shared with my purchase provider [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/dpa).

## Changes to Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is subject to change periodically. By using Twidget you accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
