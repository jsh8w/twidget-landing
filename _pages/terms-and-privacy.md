# Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
Thank you for showing an interest in Twidget. I take your privacy very seriously. I neither want nor need to know anything about your personal data. Therefore, Twidget is built to keep your data completely private.

## Authentication
Your Twitter password **never** gets shared with Twidget. When you sign into your Twitter account via Twidget, it is done securely via Twitter’s website and Twidget is given **read-only** permission to your account via a token. You can revoke Twidget’s access to your account from Twitter’s website at any time. The app **does not** have write access to your Twitter account.

## Data Storage
Twidget uses the Twitter API to fetch tweets and profile information to display in the app. This data **does not** leave your device. The latest data is cached on your device for offline use. We do not and will never share, upload, or have access to this information. All your data stays strictly on **your** device.

## Personally-Identifying Information

Twidget does not fetch or transmit any Personally-Identifying Information outside of your local device.

## Premium Purchases
If you sign-up for Twidget Premium, either via Subscription or In-App Purchase, your billing information, address, and name are all maintained by the Apple App Store and are not visible to me. I will simply get information about whether or not you have purchased a subscription/in-app purchase, the term you signed up for and when it is due to expire. This is all made available to me in an anonymous fashion. This anonymous data is also shared with my purchase provider [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/dpa).

## Advertising
For users who do not have Twidget Premium, advertisements will be displayed in the app. These are managed by Google’s AdMob system. Users have the option to enable/disable personalised ads. If enabled; Twidget will share your device's IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) with AdMob. The IDFA is a random device identifier assigned by Apple to a user’s device. Advertisers use this to track data so they can deliver customised advertising. The IDFA is used for tracking and identifying a user **without revealing personal information**. Alternatively, if personalised ads are disabled; the IDFA will not be shared and you will received random ads. You can read more about Google’s Privacy policies [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).
